# Focus CLI (WIP)

The Focus CLI is a simple yet effective Rust-based command-line tool designed to help users boost productivity by blocking access to distracting websites. With FocusGuard, users can easily specify a list of websites to be blocked, empowering them to stay focused and minimize online distractions. The tool modifies the system's hosts file to redirect specified websites to the local loopback address, preventing access during focused work sessions. Enhance your productivity and regain control of your time with FocusGuard.
